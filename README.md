<h3 align="center">Hello there, I'm Marcus! I'm a developer🚀, a hacker💻, and a student📓</h3>

## Who am I?

I'm **TheBallMarcus!**

I'm a young, open-minded, and passionate programmer who does not care about limits. **LIMITS ARE ONLY THERE TO BE BROKEN!** 🚀

I care about ***our world.*** 🌎 I think it's important that we take care of it. I care about our ~~privacy~~. 📚 The internet today is way too _dangerous_. Too many companies collect far more information than they actually need — and I believe in an [open-source world](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source).

That is the sole reason that I use [Linux](https://www.linux.org/). It's open source, it's more secure, and it's one further step toward **a better internet**. 🌐
