<h3 align="center">Hello there, I'm Marcus! I'm a developer🚀, a hacker💻, and a student📓</h3>

## Who am I?

I'm <p style="font-weight: bold;">TheBallMarcus!</p>

I'm a young, openminded and passionate programmer, who do not care about limits. <p style="font-weight: bold;">LIMITS IS ONLY THERE TO BE BROKEN!</p>



I care about ***our world.*** I think it's important that we take care of it. I care about our ~~privacy~~. The internet today is way too _dangerous_. Way to many companies collect way more information, than they actually need - and I believe in an [open source world](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source). 

That is the sore reason that I use [Linux](https://www.linux.org/). It's open source, its more secure, and it's 1 further step towards **a better internet**.
